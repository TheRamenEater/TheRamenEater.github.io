<p>The Origin Of Ramen is unclear. Like most Japanese food it originated from China.</p> <img src='https://chinatraveltoursblogger.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/blankmap-world-israel-china.png'>
<p>It was called shina soba which means Chinese Soba (Soba is a type of noodle FYI). They started to call it Ramen in thes 1950s. Eventually Ramen became so popular that it was accompanied by a new type of Ramen, instant Ramen (Known as cup Ramen in Japan FYI). </p>
